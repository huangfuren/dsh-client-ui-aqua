English | [中文](README.zh.md)

Aqua is a highly customizable glassmorphism theme for the DeepSeek Harness web UI. The header, sidebar, composer, stats line, and trajectory view all become panes of frosted glass. Two modes are built in: Floating Glass restyles the layout into floating cards, while Compatibility Mode keeps the stock layout untouched and only swaps the material to glass — so other plugins' UI gets the same treatment automatically. Glass blur, frost amount, and the backdrop are all adjustable from the settings card — pick a living fluid or drop in your own wallpaper (with its own blur and frost). Switch it off and the stock UI comes back exactly, with no source changes to DSH itself.

## Using images from the background plugin

Install [`dsh-bg-plugin`](https://github.com/huangfuren/dsh-bg-plugin) (`@deepseek-ai/dsh-bg` + `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-bg`) and aqua's wallpaper mode can use that plugin's image library directly: upload or select an image under "Settings → Background", and aqua follows it — no second upload.

- The integration is deliberately **"bg supplies the image, aqua renders it"**. The two packages stay independently switchable: turn the background plugin off and aqua quietly falls back to the fluid backdrop.
- A wallpaper uploaded inside aqua still wins; clearing it hands the job back upstream.
- Glass knobs (blur / frost / background brightness) stay in aqua; image management stays in bg — no overlap.
- Zero new endpoints: aqua reuses bg's existing `/bg-rpc` (read config) and `/bg-file/<id>` (fetch image).

## Installation


### Windows (one command)

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "Invoke-WebRequest 'https://github.com/huangfuren/dsh-client-ui-aqua/raw/main/install.ps1' -OutFile install.ps1; .\install.ps1"
```

Installs the **latest release** by default. No git needed — the installer falls back to a plain zip download. It links the plugin into the profile's `node_modules` and registers `ui-aqua` in `cordis.patch.yml` (idempotent — safe to run again). Reload the web UI and it is on.

Pin a version or track the dev branch:

```powershell
.\install.ps1 -Version 'v1.0.1'   # a specific release
.\install.ps1 -Version 'main'     # the development branch
```

### macOS / Linux (manual, three steps)

```sh
git clone --depth 1 --branch v1.0.1 https://github.com/huangfuren/dsh-client-ui-aqua.git
ln -s "$PWD/dsh-client-ui-aqua" "$DSH_HOME/profiles/node_modules/@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-aqua"
```

then append to `$DSH_HOME/profiles/web/cordis.patch.yml`:

```yaml
- insert:
    - id: ui-aqua
      name: '@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-aqua'
```

Reload the web UI. Aqua is **on by default**; the master switch lives in **Settings → Plugins → Glass theme** (same shape as the other plugin cards), and every other control sits directly under **Settings → General → Appearance** (no title of its own). With the master switch off, the whole control block under Appearance is hidden.

**v1.0.9:** a dedicated **Glass theme** toggle row is also registered in **Settings → General**, right under the built-in **Font size** row (the General section sorts by numeric `order`: Font size is `11`, so the toggle uses `11.4` and the knob block `11.5` — no collision with any built-in row). It renders as label + pill button + one-line hint, so the theme can be switched on/off without opening the Plugins tab.
